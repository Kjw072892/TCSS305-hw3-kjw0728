Assignment 3

Kassie Whitney

Winter 2025

## Assignment Overview
The purpose of this assignment was to attach the backend to the GUI using mouse listeners and action listners. 
We had to code listeners to the buttons on the application so that they perform expected actions, ie the undo button 
undos the previous paint stroke, and the clear button clears the canvas.
We also had to code mouse listeners and mouse motion listeners to the canvas and retrieve mouse data from these 
captured mouse events and send them to the appropriate methods that paints the shape objects on to the canvas.

## Technical Impression:
This assignment was a bit challenging in the sense that its all new material, and it required us to get 
familiaraized with the java doc, because the API just gave us the most basic set of instructions, ie instructions on 
what each method does, the application expected outcome, and naming conventions for the different panels we had 
instantiate.
The lectures we recieved was very informative, however it was challenging to try to translate what we learned apply 
it to our assignment since we are working with many different classes (however we are only working inside 2 classes, 
though this was only realized in hindsight).
The overall logic of the application wasn't difficult esspecially compared to the logic that was required for 
assignment 2 "RoadRage"; GUI application was never taught in CSS 143 at Tacoma 
Community College, so this was very much new territory and a great learning opportunity.
So not only was this new territory, but we were only given a week to get familiar with the code base, learn about 
action listeners and mouse listeners and how to translate that knowledge into our assignment.
This assignment most certainly felt like a sprint, so that in itself made the assignment quite challenging.
